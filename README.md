## Prototype application of EV battery supply chain system

This is a prototype application development of my proposed EV battery supply chain system.

### Overview

- This diagram shows an overview of this prototype system.

- User IDs and passwords are centrally managed by a management organization (e.g. car manufacturer) and inquired when necessary (cannot be changed or added arbitrarily).

- If the ID or password is incorrect, a warning will be displayed.

- Jump to the Web application form(not ready yet) by clicking the SignUp button.

- You can login with USER_ID: admin and PASSWORD: admin. You can move to the Home view and check the explanation and how to use it(Japanese).

- Return to the login window with the Logout button.

![logout](./ReadmeImages/Logout.png)

- Exit with the X button on the upper right.

- Register battery information in the Register view.

- If there are blanks or the already registered battery number is entered, a warning will be displayed.  
  If there is no problem, "登録しました！" is displayed.

- In the Add view, you can read registered battery information and add vehicle information.

- When you press the "バッテリーデータ読み込み" button after entering battery number, the manufacturing date and material number are automatically entered.

- If you press the button without entering the battery number, a warning will be displayed.

![add2](./ReadmeImages/Add2.png)

- If you enter an unregistered battery number and press the button, a warning will be displayed.

![add3](./ReadmeImages/Add3.png)

- After the data is automatically entered, enter other additional information and press the Add button to add the information.   
  If there is no problem, "追加しました。" is displayed.

- If there are blanks, a warning will be displayed.

<img src="./ReadmeImages/Add5.png" width="400px">

- If you try to add new information when other information(Vehicle number, etc.) has already been added, a warning will be displayed.  
  (This is because this system assumes a blockchain system. Basically, registration and addition are only done once, and deletion and modification of information are carefully done after verification.)

![add6](./ReadmeImages/Add6.png)

- In the View window, you can check the registered battery information.  
  - All information is managed in Int type.

- You can move to any page(Home, Register, Add, View) with the button on the left bar.(input information is not retained)

### 2.Library & Other

- Java DB Driver - derby.jar
- Java DB Driver - derbyclient.jar
- Java DB Driver - derbynet.jar
- rs2xml.jar
- JDK 18

### 3.Improvement & Application

- Replace JavaDB(Derby) with blockchain system.

- Application of automated input of information to prevent fraud and manual entry errors.

- Addition of various stakeholders and accompanying additional individual information.

- Further improvement of UI and UX.
